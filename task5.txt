ML Task 5: Classification
Objective:
The objective of this assessment is to evaluate your understanding and ability to apply supervised learning techniques to a real-world dataset.
Dataset:
Use the breast cancer dataset available in the sklearn library.
Key components to be fulfilled :
1. Loading and Preprocessing
   - Load the breast cancer dataset from sklearn.
   - Preprocess the data to handle any missing values and perform necessary feature scaling.
   - Explain the preprocessing steps you performed and justify why they are necessary for this dataset.
2. Classification Algorithm Implementation
   - Implement the following five classification algorithms:
     1. Logistic Regression
     2. Decision Tree Classifier
     3. Random Forest Classifier
     4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
     5. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
   - For each algorithm, provide a brief description of how it works and why it might be suitable for this dataset.
3. Model Comparison
   - Compare the performance of the five classification algorithms.
   - Which algorithm performed the best and which one performed the worst?
